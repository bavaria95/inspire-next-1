How to Connect to the PostgreSQL Database
=========================================

1. About
--------

In inspire-next stores all the data in a postgresql database. 
This document specifies how to connect and query the inspire's PostgreSQL database.
We access it thorught the docker-containers.


2. Run the web container
------------------------

The first step is run the web container, in order to start our database.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker-compose run --rm web


3. Connect to the PostgresSQL Database
--------------------------------------

When all the containers are up you have to open a new console and run the following command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker-compose exec database psql -U inspirehep

.. code-block:: sql

    psql (9.2.18, server 9.4.5)
    WARNING: psql version 9.2, server version 9.4.
             Some psql features might not work.
    Type "help" for help.

    inspirehep=#


Now you have an interactive console to query the inspire SQL database.
In case PostgreSQL requires the authentication credentials the password for the inspirehep database is `dbpass123`


4. PostgreSQL useful commands
-----------------------------

A list of useful commands:

- ``\h`` this lists all the sql commands that you can run
- ``\dt`` this lists all the tables
- ``\l`` this lists all the databases
- ``\e`` this will open the editor, where you can edit the queries and save it. By doing so the query will get executed.
- ``\?`` this shows the PSQL command prompt help


5. Search a record with the uuid
--------------------------------

Given the uuid of a record you can obtain the record running this query:

.. code-block:: sql

    select * from records_metadata where id = YOUR_UUID;


6. Search a record with the pid
--------------------------------

Given the pid of a record you can obtain the record running this query:

.. code-block:: sql

    select * from pidstore_pid, records_metadata where records_metadata.id = pidstore_pid.object_uuid where pidstore_pid.id = YOUR_PID_ID;
